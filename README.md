Milestone 1
#1 Since my undergraduate years, I have harbored a distinct fascination for facial decoration. This passion deepened when I ventured into designing special effects on faces for a previous assignment. The experience solidified my resolve to pursue endeavors closely tied to this creative pursuit.

During my undergraduate studies, I delved into the design of a mask exploring the symbolic nuances of utopia. This assignment served as a pivotal moment, inspiring me to further develop and innovate upon my initial concept. In line with this, I envision replacing the traditional mask with a light bulb adorned with beads. Leveraging Arduino programming, I aim to orchestrate a dynamic display, illuminating the beads in a sequence at specified intervals. This evolution of my earlier idea not only builds upon my prior work but also introduces a captivating blend of symbolism and technology, showcasing my commitment to pushing creative boundaries.

#2 I aimed to create a flower that automatically opens its petals when touched from above, with the added feature of emitting light from its core.

#3 I intended to craft a small butterfly that responds to touch by fluttering its wings. The wings should remain still when there is no touch input.
